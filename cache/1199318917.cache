Boxloader works with both vanilla and mod vehicles that are properly configured with VIV transport capability, such as some vehicles from RHS or CUP. Boxloader uses Arma's built in Vehicle in Vehicle functionality, which supports loading of most ammoboxes and physics objects.\r\n\r\nThe mod is partially modular in nature, and is divided into several PBOs:\r\n\r\nboxloader.pbo: Adds cargo loading/unloading actions to the player, as well as the base framework for the other modules.\r\n\r\nboxloader_cargo.pbo: Adds a handful of cargo objects in sizes not already present in arma, including large pallets of ammo, fuel tanks, repair parts, etc.\r\n\r\nboxloader_fort.pbo: adds fortifications using a construction system, they can be transported with VIV, then built on-site using enabled \"construction vehicles\".\r\n\r\nboxloader_pallet.pbo: adds empty pallets that can be loaded with cargo, and loaded into other vehicles. See note below.\r\n\r\nboxloader_retrofit.pbo: Adds cargo support vanilla vehicles, as well as some mods, via \"retrofits\"; invisible custom objects that act as the actual VIV carrier, attached to the vehicle in question. See note below.\r\n\r\nboxloader_tractor.pbo: a rudimentary port of the arma 2 tractor, with a low-poly bucket(construction vehicle) or forklift attachment. Useful for loading/unloading and building fortifications, if you have nothing else to do it with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: \"stacking\" attachTo can cause unintended effects, an object attached to an object attached to an object will not behave properly, this includes the Vehicle in Vehicle system, and it's a behavior of the game engine. \r\n\r\nRetrofit vehicles rely on an attached invisible helper object, so any cargo loaded will be \"stacked\". Cargo loaded into pallets loaded into vehicles will also result in \"stacking\".  Vehicles with native Arma 3 Vehicle in Vehicle support have their cargo attached directly to them, unless a pallet is used as an intermediary.\r\n\r\n\"Stacked\" cargo will jitter back and forth when moving at speed. The AI gets confused when transporting stacked cargo. Aircraft transporting stacked cargo can explode. The \"hide cargo\" action will make the cargo invisible, preventing it from misbehaving. Both the \"hide cargo\" action and the retrofit system can be disabled in Boxloader's CBA options if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1201499127]Compatibility mod to make boxloader_cargo objects use ACE rearm/refuel/etc[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1321838514]My collection of vehicle mods designed around Boxloader.[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://github.com/VurtualRuler98/BoxLoader/]GitHub[/url]","time_created":1510501859,"time_updated":1612457411,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":55104,"favorited":2653,"lifetime_subscriptions":126190,"lifetime_favorited":3025,"views":85058,"tags":[{"tag":"Wheeled"},{"tag":"Mod"},{"tag":"Equipment"},{"tag":"Mechanics"},{"tag":"Structure"}]}]}}
