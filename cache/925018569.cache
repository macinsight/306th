But it is optional.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Only the clients need the mod\r\n- Every type of vehicle works, but with high speeds, you migth slide off\r\n- Addon is only script based, so the experience migth be glichy in some cases :-)\r\n- Scripts need to run on each frame so you will experience a decrease of perfomance\r\n- Does work in MP, but doesn`t look too smooth for other players\r\n- If you want to ride an object that is not in \"vehicles\" you can add it to the WMO_specialObjects array\r\n- Server Owners: You may have to add \"disableCollisionWith\" and \"enableCollisionWith\" to your cfgRemoteexec filters\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBig thanks to BadBenson who helped me a lot with MP testing, giving suggestions and providing a better version of my \"proof of concept\" adaptive roadway!\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment with feedback. I will try to update this if needed ;)\r\n\r\nBI Forum: https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/204602-wmo-walkable-moving-objects\r\n\r\nGITHUB: https://github.com/Bloodwyn/Arma-3-WMO","time_created":1494694872,"time_updated":1649270525,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":221431,"favorited":7619,"lifetime_subscriptions":399899,"lifetime_favorited":8430,"views":211517,"tags":[{"tag":"Mod"},{"tag":"Mechanics"}]}]}}
