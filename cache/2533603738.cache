I've attempted to depict the Malden Security Forces as an appropriately sized security force for an island of 500 according to lore, so don't expect a full fledged defence force capable of taking on CSAT singlehandedly, expect a force more oriented to fighting piracy and internal security that would make for good insurgents in the case of an external invasion. \r\n\r\nThis faction should also make for a good low capability counterpart to my GM: CSAT North Africa mod. \r\n\r\n[b]FEATURES[/b]\r\n- Blufor Malden Security Forces faction\r\n- Set up for zeus (if module set up correctly)\r\n- Unique insignia for the faction\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin my discord: https://discord.gg/ptrCdbAj2B\r\n\r\nALIVE Classnames\r\n- ACM_B_MSF\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n- Mondkalb for providing me the patch/insignia template.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n- I am NOT taking requests\r\n- I am NOT accepting suggestions\r\n- BISIGN and BIKEY included\r\n- I have not added crates, dont bother telling me cus im aware of it\r\n- Take bug reports to the official bug reporting channel of my discord where i will actually pay attention to it.\r\n\r\n[b]FAQ[/b]\r\n- Where can i use this?\r\nin missions or the editor\r\n- Why do some units have AK's and the Coast Guard; M16's?\r\nI incorporated a bit of Arma lore and figured that Malden probably has a warehouse of leftover Soviet and American equipment that was left behind.\r\n- Can you do X?\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/oldBGiK.png[/img]\r\nArma Public Licence - Share Alike\r\n","time_created":1625147094,"time_updated":1630689536,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":2148,"favorited":564,"lifetime_subscriptions":5742,"lifetime_favorited":624,"views":25019,"tags":[{"tag":"Helicopter"},{"tag":"Wheeled"},{"tag":"Tracked"},{"tag":"Mod"},{"tag":"Equipment"}]}]}}
