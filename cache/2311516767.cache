The crayons included are not currently smokable or edible, but will be a visible item that you can equip to display a crayon model in your mouth. There may be future compatibility for use with Immersion Cigs.\r\n\r\n[h1]Included Content[/h1]\r\nEleven crayon [strike]flavors[/strike] colors as facewear options\r\n- Brown\r\n- Red\r\n- Orange\r\n- Yellow\r\n- Green\r\n- Blue\r\n- Purple\r\n- Black\r\n- Gray\r\n- White\r\n- Pink\r\n\r\n[b]This mod is not affiliated with Immersion Cigs, RHS, or their respective creators.[/b]\r\nAll included models, textures, and configuration were done by Vespade.\r\n\r\n[H1]License[/H1]\r\n[img]https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png[/img]\r\nThis work is licensed under a [url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/]Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License[/url].","time_created":1607299581,"time_updated":1607389883,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":4742,"favorited":379,"lifetime_subscriptions":10037,"lifetime_favorited":415,"views":25590,"tags":[{"tag":"Mod"},{"tag":"Equipment"}]}]}}
