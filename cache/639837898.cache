Clients don't need it.\r\n - Optionally, this can be installed directly in the mission PBO by calling the advanced towing script via initServer.sqf. You'll find the sqf script (fn_advancedTowingInit.sqf) in the addons directory inside the downloaded addon.\r\n \r\n[h1]Default Towing Rules:[/h1]\r\n\r\n - Tanks can tow tanks, cars, ships and air\r\n - Cars can tow cars, ships and air\r\n - Trucks can tow cars, ships and air\r\n - Ships can only tow ships\r\n - You can't tow locked vehicles (see settings below)\r\n - You can only tow up to two vehicles in a chain at a time (see settings below)\r\n \r\n[h1]Notes for Mission Makers:[/h1]\r\n\r\nYou can enable \"trains\" of vehicles by defining the SA_MAX_TOWED_CARGO varible in your init.sqf file. By default, this is set to 2. When enabled, vehicles can tow up to the max number of specified vehicles. If you try to tow more, your vehicle won't be able to move.\r\n\r\nSA_MAX_TOWED_CARGO = 3;\r\n\r\nYou can customize which classes of objects can \"deploy\" tow ropes by overriding the SA_TOW_SUPPORTED_VEHICLES_OVERRIDE variable in an init.sqf file.\r\n\r\nSA_TOW_SUPPORTED_VEHICLES_OVERRIDE = [noparse][ \"Air\", \"Ship\" ];[/noparse]\r\n\r\nThis will only allow objects of class Air and Ship deploy tow ropes\r\n\r\nYou can customize what can and can't be towed by defining the SA_TOW_RULES_OVERRIDE variable in the init.sqf file.\r\n\r\nSA_TOW_RULES_OVERRIDE =\r\n[noparse]       [ [\"Air\", \"CAN_TOW\", \"Ship\"], [/noparse]\r\n[noparse]        [\"Air\", \"CAN_TOW\", \"Air\"], [/noparse]\r\n[noparse]        [\"Ship\", \"CANT_TOW\", \"Air\"], [/noparse]\r\n[noparse]        [\"Ship\", \"CAN_TOW\", \"Ship\"] [/noparse]\r\n[noparse]]; [/noparse]\r\n\r\nIn this example, all objects of class Air can tow Ships and Air. However, Ships can only tow ships.\r\n\r\nYou can allow towing of locked vehicles by defining SA_TOW_LOCKED_VEHICLES_ENABLED in your init.sqf file. It defaults to false.\r\n\r\nSA_TOW_LOCKED_VEHICLES_ENABLED = true;\r\n\r\nYou can allow towing in an Exile safe zone by defining SA_TOW_IN_EXILE_SAFEZONE_ENABLED in your init.sqf file. It default to false.\r\n\r\nSA_TOW_IN_EXILE_SAFEZONE_ENABLED = true;\r\n\r\n[h1]Not working on your server?[/h1]\r\n\r\nMake sure you have the mod listed in the -serverMod command line option. Only -serverMod is required for this addon. If still not working, check your server log to make sure the addon is found.\r\n\r\n[h1]Issues & Feature Requests[/h1]\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sethduda/AdvancedTowing/issues\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to help fix any of these, please let me know. You can fork the repo and create a pull request.\r\n\r\n[h1]Source[/h1]\r\n\r\nYou can find the latest source here: https://github.com/sethduda/AdvancedTowing\r\n\r\n[h1]FAQ[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]This addon is only required on the server - is it going to slow down my server?[/b]\r\n\r\nNo - while this addon is server-side only, it installs itself on all clients without them downloading the addon. Most of the time, the towing code actually runs client-side, even though you installed the addon only on the server. Magic!\r\n\r\n[b]Why is the vehicle I'm towing jumpy/laggy?[/b]\r\n\r\nIf you're towing a vehicle that another player is driving, it's slower to transmit position updates for the towed vehicle. This will result in laggy looking towing. Have the player move to the passenger seat and then re-attach the tow ropes.\r\n\r\nAlso, when using this in MP, all other players watching someone tow something will also notice the towed vehicle isn't moving as smoothly. This is also due to network delay. Usually this isn't too noticeable unless moving very fast.\r\n\r\n[b]Battleye kicks me when I try to do xyz. What do I do?[/b]\r\n\r\nYou need to configure Battleye rules on your server. Below are the two files you need to configure:\r\n\r\nsetvariable.txt\r\n\r\nAdd the following exclusions to the end of all lines starting with 4, 5, 6, or 7 if they contain \"\" (meaning applies to all values):\r\n\r\n!=\"SA_Cargo\" !=\"SA_Tow_Ropes\" !=\"SA_Tow_Ropes_Vehicle\" !=\"SA_Tow_Ropes_Pick_Up_Helper\"\r\n\r\nsetvariableval.txt\r\n\r\nIf you have any lines starting with 4, 5, 6, or 7 and they contain \"\" (meaning applies to all values) it's not going to work. Either remove the line or explicitly define the values you want to kick. Since the values of the variables above can vary, I don't know of a good way to define an exclusion rule.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's possible there are other battleye filter files that can cause issues. If you check your battleye logs you can figure out which file is causing a problem.\r\n\r\n[b]The tow actions appear when looking at a vehicle, but do nothing when I select them. How do I fix that?[/b]\r\n\r\nMost likely your server is setup with a white list for remote executions. In order to fix this, you need to modify your mission's description.ext file, adding the following CfgRemoteExec rules. If using InfiStar you should edit your cfgremoteexec.hpp instead of the description.ext file. See https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Remote_Execution for more details on CfgRemoteExec.\r\n\r\nclass CfgRemoteExec\r\n{\r\n    class Functions\r\n    {\r\n        class SA_Simulate_Towing    { allowedTargets=0; }; \r\n        class SA_Attach_Tow_Ropes   { allowedTargets=0; }; \r\n        class SA_Take_Tow_Ropes     { allowedTargets=0; }; \r\n        class SA_Put_Away_Tow_Ropes { allowedTargets=0; }; \r\n        class SA_Pickup_Tow_Ropes   { allowedTargets=0; }; \r\n        class SA_Drop_Tow_Ropes     { allowedTargets=0; }; \r\n        class SA_Set_Owner      { allowedTargets=2; }; \r\n        class SA_Hint           { allowedTargets=1; }; \r\n        class SA_Hide_Object_Global  { allowedTargets=2; }; \r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\n[b]How do I tow a boat like in the picture?[/b]\r\n\r\nDiesel made a great script for this.
