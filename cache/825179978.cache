It adds additional, weapon-sound related features to the game. Those are hill/mountain reverb and reflections, forest reflections as well as reflections from houses in urban areas.\r\nThe basic principle is: Firing a weapon creates a loud noise, noise is waves that swing through the air/make the air swing and those waves get reflected off objects and terrain. The volume levels were done with my soundmod \"DynaSound 2\" in mind, but ES works with every mod including the vanilla sounds since nothing \"core\" is changed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[b]Real-time calculated Hill/mountain reverb:[/b]\r\nThe feature simulates the reflection of the gunshot-noise when there are hills around you. The further the mountain/hill, the more diffuse the reflection will be. Close terrain will reflect a clear \"popp\", while mountains in the distance will send back a diffuse, \"crumbly\" echo. The feature is calculated in real-time and real-environment, meaning you will actually be able to see the mountain the shot got reflected from.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[b]Forest reverb:[/b]\r\nSo many trees and plants around you create some kind of \"half-enclosed space\". You will hear a thick layer all around you when firing inside a forest!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[b]Urban reverb:[/b]\r\nThe many hard surfaces of houses in urban areas give a very direct and harsh reflection when firing a gun. The mod simulates this by playing slapback sounds from the actual walls when firing next to houses in urban areas. The result is a \"thickened\" feeling when firing your gun.","time_created":1482622418,"time_updated":1581433344,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":231123,"favorited":6051,"lifetime_subscriptions":424111,"lifetime_favorited":6760,"views":184459,"tags":[{"tag":"Mod"},{"tag":"Sound"}]}]}}
