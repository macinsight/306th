(Similar to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019) [/h1]\r\n\r\nVersion: 3.0 \r\nAnimation and code was maded from scratch by me.\r\n\r\n[h1]You can customize your keybinds, enable or disable Double Shift press, and other params in CBA settings. (First screenshot)  [/h1]\r\nAll of the settings client-sided, that means that if you dont like alternative MG run animation, you can disable that, but other players will still use it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead this before usage:\r\n[list]\r\n [*]With alternative running you will run faster, but it will cost more stamina (Compatibly with ACE3 stamina!)\r\n [*]With bolt rifles or machineguns I have made a special animation, it will play if you carry these weapons. (Now you can disable that in CBA settings)\r\n [*]The alternative run is only supports rifles,pistols and launchers!\r\n [*]You cant use alternative running if you are out of stamina, or if your legs are damaged.\r\n[*]You can use alternative running even in water and special animation will be played.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nKnown bugs:\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nHinde [2 R ANG] - inspiration, idea.\r\nMacser - For awesome ArmaRig for blender!\r\nBohemia Interactive - For awesome game and platform!\r\nKKA3 (Or Kola) - for helping me with some of the stuff.","time_created":1597507162,"time_updated":1638909011,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":65540,"favorited":2777,"lifetime_subscriptions":112731,"lifetime_favorited":3041,"views":54319,"tags":[{"tag":"Mod"},{"tag":"Animation"},{"tag":"Mechanics"}]}]}}
