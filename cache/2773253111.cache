Also added standard version of fuel crate but with fuel cargo capability - amount of one barrel is 250 liters so on one crate is 1000l - (I don't understand why moders and even BIS not setting correcly fuelcapacity and consumption on real levels, it should be 1/1).\r\n- Refill of canisters and barels work in range 3m from fuel source, if source have cargo fuel or fuel in tank it can be transfered to canister or barrel from it.\r\n- During refill or refuel canister and barel animate cover and level of liquide inside up/down,\r\n- Empty barrels and canisters stay with open covers, \r\n- Option for checking of canister/barel level,\r\n- Added posibility of use oryginal arma's vehinveh cargo areas in vehicles to store cargo,\r\n- Change order to use drill function (cargo fuel first)\r\n- Added config entries for ACE\r\n- manage vehicle in vehicle feature for load/unload crates and barrels if vehicle have it in config\r\n- added replaced real values of fuela capacity for most types of vehicles in RHS and USAF.\r\n\r\ntip: for pickup canisters you must have free hands ! (so no weapons in hands is allowed).\r\n\r\ntesting this feature but mainly works:\r\nYou can define in any vehicle cargo your own custom area to load cans fuels or crates (if they fit in it) - You must declare in that vehicle box  coordinates like this:\r\n\r\nin init field in editor or added by script:\r\n( quad class)\r\nthis setvariable [\"cargoarea\",[[0.46,0.91,-0.55],[-0.45,0.27,0.1],[0,-1.5,-0.5],2,0.1,0.05],true]\r\nwhere[0.46,0.91,-0.55],[-0.45,0.27,0.1],[0,-1.5,-0.5],2,0.1,0.05]mean:\r\n[0.46,0.91,-0.55] point 1 (back/left/bottom) corner\r\n[-0.45,0.27,0.1] point 2 (front/right/up) corner\r\n[0,-1.5,-0.5] point 3 of load/unload\r\n2 area of activation load/unload action around point 3\r\n0.1 x spacing between cargo\r\n0.05 y spacing between cargo\r\noptional values:\r\n\"otocvez\" selection of loaded cargo attached to if for example cargo is loaded on tank turret\r\n[\"HWK_MetalBarrel\"] types of cargo possibile to load on vehicle (used for tanks for load only fuel barrels)\r\n\r\nexample of list file (cargo_offeset.sqf):\r\n_cargo_areas_config = [\r\n[\"rhsusf_m1a2sep1tuskid_usarmy\",[[-0.63,-2.5,-0.2],[0.75,-2.07,0.3],[0,-4.5,-1.9],2,\"otocvez\"]],\r\n[\"rhsusf_m1a2sep1d_usarmy\",[[-0.63,-2.5,-0.2],[0.75,-2.07,0.3],[0,-4,-1.9],2,\"otocvez\"]],\r\n[\"rhs_t90am_tv\",[[-0.973,-4.332,-0.802],[0.863,-3.709,-0.178],[0,-4.5,-1.8],2,0.13,0,\"\",[\"HWK_MetalBarrel\"]]],\r\n[\"rhs_t90sab_tv\",[[-0.973,-4.332,-0.802],[0.863,-3.709,-0.178],[0,-4.5,-1.8],2,0.13,0,\"\",[\"HWK_MetalBarrel\"]]],\r\n];\r\n\r\nvisualisation of those cargo areas is visible on screens as yelow balls (on screens are generated all 8 corners of box not only those 2 needed to define area, the same definition is used in vehicle transport system.\r\n\r\nknown problems:\r\n- adjusting cargo in vehicles not always work correctly but more and more valid :)\r\n","time_created":1646443354,"time_updated":1677785077,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":1450,"favorited":239,"lifetime_subscriptions":2689,"lifetime_favorited":262,"views":6152,"tags":[{"tag":"Equipment"},{"tag":"Mechanics"},{"tag":"Mod"}]}]}}
