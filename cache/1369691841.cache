JOIN OUR DISCORD HERE:  https://discord.gg/f4vhPzy\r\n\r\n\"On behalf of the CFP team we are extremely excited to announce a new community mod designed to bring a rich and diverse set of factions to Arma 3! This ambitious project is off to a flying start with 73(!) new or enhanced factions, over 900 new custom retextures,  items, and support for ZEUS, VCOM, ACE3 and ALiVE. We're building factions using CUP as a base, as CUP includes a huge array of vehicles, weapons and equipment in use by today's aggressors. We specifically built the factions with mission making in mind, with a wide variety of groups (including static weapons) and support for mods such as ALiVE and VCOM. We're very thankful to the community donations of assets so far and we welcome the community in helping us bring more factions to Arma 3!\" - CFP Lead Developers - Tupolov & AuburnAlumni\r\n\r\nCFP is a community project to provide Arma 3 with 100 new or enhanced real world factions/sub-factions involved in current and historical armed conflicts. \r\n\r\nCFP offers not only enhanced vanilla CUP factions but also a huge number of new factions using CUP and community donated assets.
