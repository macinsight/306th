At the same time I try to stay historical as far as possible. As an example, only those vehicles that were actually equipped with an intercom and radios will receive them.\r\n\r\nBecause of the missing models for ACRE2, all vehicles are equipped with an AN-PRC117F, even if this is not correct. If appropriate radios are available for ACRE2 at any time, a changeover to them is within the realm of possibility.\r\n\r\n[h1]Key Features[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Belt linking for MG3 and PKM\r\n    [*]Buddy reloading to the Carl Gustav\r\n    [*]Proper ACE3 fuel configs for all vehicles\r\n    [*]Proper ACE3 rearm, repair and refuel functions to all service vehicles\r\n    [*]ACRE Intercom and/or Radios to all egible vehicles\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nBug reports and feature requests: [url=https://github.com/vpzbrig21/gme/issues]GitHub[/url]\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vpzbrig21/gme/master/extras/assets/APL-SA.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Legal Notice[/b]\r\nAny reupload found on the Steam-Workshop will get a DMCA take down without a warning!","time_created":1605054763,"time_updated":1663239589,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":563,"favorited":75,"lifetime_subscriptions":1373,"lifetime_favorited":82,"views":4494,"tags":[{"tag":"Mod"},{"tag":"Mechanics"}]}]}}
