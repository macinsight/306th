If that happens, leave a comment and I'll do my best to fix it.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]This mod should be compatible with both the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=894678801]Beta[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620019431]non-beta[/url] releases of TFAR.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod plays one of three animations while the player is using a radio. The mod also adds a new handset model which is by default, used by the larger, backpack-carried radios.\r\n\r\nThe animations include a headset animation, a vest mounted radio/push-to-talk animation, and holding the handset/radio in your hand.\r\n\r\nThe mod will choose which animation to play based on whether the user has a vest with a radio, an earpiece, or otherwise. (This can be configured)\r\n\r\n[h2]Configuration[/h2]\r\n[b]CBA Settings:[/b] \r\n[list]  \r\n[*][b]Enable Addon[/b] - Turns addon on/off.\r\n[*][b]Headset List[/b] - Array containing helmets/goggles that should be considered when doing the ear animation. Use '[ headgear player, goggles player]' to allow all helmets/goggles.\r\n[*][b]Vest List[/b] - Array containing vests that should be considered when doing the vest animation. Use '[vest player]' to allow all vests.\r\n[*][b]Add Vests with Armor to List[/b] - If enabled, all vests that have an armor value will be automatically added to the Vest List.\r\n[*][b]Aiming while Talking[/b] - If enabled, players will be able to aim while using a radio.\r\n[*][b]Disable Aiming while Talking[/b] - Disables ADS for primary weapons while talking over radio.\r\n[*][b]Disable Animation in Vehicles[/b] - If enabled, the animations will not be played in vehicles.\r\n[*][b]Preferred Animation[/b] - Preferred Animation for this radio. Doesn't mean that it will always be used as the vest/ear animations are only used when the player has a vest/headset from the vest/headset list.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]CBA Controls:[/b] \r\n[list]  \r\n[*][b]Listen to Radio[/b] - Holds radio up to your ear when held down.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Mod Compatibility[/h2]\r\nIf you run this mod with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=843577117]RHSUSAF[/url], the AN/PRC-152 model from RHS will be used.\r\n\r\n[h2]Plug[/h2]\r\nTheSpeshalPlatoon is currently recruiting!
