And some things are just placeholders for the time being.\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] Some uniforms and other items are moved from the core Mod to the USMC, VDV and VMF Expansions. This was necessary because in the end there was a huge mess of all kind of items.\r\nSo if you're missing an item in an mission or in the editor: Load these Expansions and they should be back.\r\n\r\nMissions and campaigns are released as separate workshop items for easier maintenance. \r\n\r\nNow, this Mod would not have been possible without:\r\n* The CUP team, which created not only one of the most popular Mods but serve as a base for CWR III.\r\n* 3 Commando Brigade : M939 Trucks and SCUD launcher.\r\n* Basher : OPFOR uniforms, equipment, headgear textures\r\n* Batteriefuhrer : Responsible for most of the unit textures.\r\n* beppe_goodoldrebel : Vests from his '80s pack.\r\n* Bossman : Propaganda material\r\n* ColdWarChris : MERDC and C-130 textures.\r\n* DSabre : Sopwith Camel model and textures.\r\n* EMSI : Sharing his UI config wisdom with us.\r\n* Freddo : Option to enable/disable Spotlight in Addon Options.\r\n* Ghost : Couple of scripts still being used in our missions.\r\n* hcpookie : Proper working MM-1 grenade launcher\r\n* joker006 : Fixed the Trabant and Bus models so they actually work.\r\n* Lakarak : Edited SSh-40 Russian Helmet Model\r\n* lamasutra : Resistance campaig, Scripting.\r\n* lemonium : Desert units and vehicles configuration\r\n* Lorenluke : Improved our Scud launcher script\r\n* max1048 : Soviet equipment meshes (6B3, 6B5, vests)\r\n* maxjoiner : Thank you for supplying us with a working female character.\r\n* MaxPower : Contributing his truly splended AH-1 and Trabant models.\r\n* Mikero : Without his tools, this would be a pile of junk. Seriously.\r\n* Motta : M1 Helmet Model\r\n* Shuko : His Taskmaster script used everywhere.\r\n* sinmercardo : New US Army uniforms\r\n* slatts : Sharing a fair amount of his former Conflict '85 stuff\r\n* Stagler : Models and configs fixing, again and again (usually after I touched them).\r\n* Temon : Thanks for your OFP face textures.\r\n* Tini : Models/Textures\r\n* Trento : Models/Textures\r\n* Urban : Adding/Fixing various vehicle lights.\r\n* vilas : Mini Cooper, Skoda Rapid, UAZ-452, T-64 and furniture models.\r\n* Xeno/Xacino : Soviet uniform (M69, M55/63), equipment, headgear (berets) meshes\r\n* Everyone else we accidently forgot\r\n\r\nLast but not least, the legal stuff\r\n[i]CWR III END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)[/i]\r\n\r\nThe work contained in this distribution is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0.\r\n\r\nIt is forbidden to distribute the content of this package by itself, or as part of another distribution, using the Steam Workshop by anyone other than Cold War Rearmed III Team.\r\nYou may NOT use the material for any commercial purposes.
