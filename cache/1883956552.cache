We have found that it completely changes how we play on terrains that we've known for over a decade.\r\n\r\nIt replaces the buildings on any terrain or mission that uses them (i.e. even third party terrains that depend on CUP, such as Beketov). It does not require ownership of the Contact DLC as Bohemia Interactive made the assets available to all ArmA 3 owners.\r\n\r\nThere are some glitches where the ground clips through the floors of buildings; it is unlikely that we will be able to fix this in the near future.\r\n\r\n[h1]Feedback[/h1]\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues on our [url=https://gitlab.com/16AA/LSR/lsr-public]repository[/url].
